## What is this?

Sublime Text conveniently contains most of its user-specific modifications and packages in a single location. By backing up this folder we can quickly get a fresh installation of Sublime Text customized to our liking.


## How?

Load up Sublime Text and install the Package Manager, then close it. Locate your Sublime Text User folder and dump the contents of this repo inside.

The next time you run Sublime Text, the Package Manager should begin installing all missing packages -- let this continue until finished. ðŸ™Œ

It may be necessary to dump the contents of this repo into your User folder once more if anything was overwritten.
